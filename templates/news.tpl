					<div class="newscontent">
						<p>There will be no more video watching or video game playing at the Help Desk. There are occasional exceptions to this rule - tech tip videos or other technology-related videos.
            Unless it is work related though, there will be no more videos.  Most definitely there will be no movies or hour long television shows.  We don't pay you to watch movies or play video games.  
            <br><br>
						Should someone happen to watch something inappropriate for work or play a video game, that person will be immediately <b>furloughed</b>. They can go home to watch tv on their own time, and if things 
            get busy at any point during the remainder of their shift, they can be called back into work. 
            <br><br>
            In the absence of all this video watching, we all know that there are busy times and lulls at the Desk, and at night, those lulls can be rather long.  Acceptable down time activities would include:
            </p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Working on training tracker goals</li>
							<li>Writing documentation for the wiki</li>
							<li>Reviewing documentation on the Help Desk blog or Moodle course</li>
							<li>Learning a new skill (for example, working on a project in Photoshop or creating a Mahara profile)</li>

           </ul>
